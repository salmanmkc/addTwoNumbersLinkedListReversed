# addTwoNumbersLinkedListReversed

It all works, I can add huge lists,however when having a 31 digit number causes an overflow exception which I need to figure out how to get around, I've got BigIntegers, tried deecimal, UInt64/ulong, long and every time I submit it gives me a larger number, in this cse 31 digits long.
